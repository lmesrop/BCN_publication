We evaluated potential batch effects between samples from different RNA-seq runs and extraction methods and found that the results remained consistent across all conditions. Batch effects were assessed using the empiricalBayesLM function from WGCNA. Notably, over 80% of co-expressed genes were shared between the original and batch-corrected BCN networks.
