# Abstract 

Exocrine glands are secretory structures that evolved through widespread convergent evolution and lineage-specific innovation to produce a variety of products, including pheromones and toxins, that play key roles in ecosystem dynamics. One type of exocrine function – secreted bioluminescence – evolved convergently many times to generate light and transform biodiversity through new predator-prey and courtship interactions. However, to what extent lineage-specific secretory bioluminescence evolved using deeply conserved genes is unclear, but could significantly advance the idea of similar evolutionary patterns underpinning diverse, convergent, and ecologically impactful secretory innovations. Here we report differential gene expression, co-expression, and comparative analyses of the light-emitting upper lip of the bioluminescent ostracod Vargula tsujii and a non-luminous relative. We show a functionally characterized luciferase is co-expressed with many conserved genes containing secretory signatures, including toxin-like genes. In addition, a preponderance of novel genes originated concurrently with ostracod bioluminescence, many of which are differentially expressed in the light-producing upper lip. Therefore, this secretory bioluminescent system exemplifies a broader, yet still rarely demonstrated pattern of exocrine evolution, whereby novel genes and co-expression networks build upon deeply conserved secretory genes to generate diverse biochemical products with significant ecosystem impacts.
